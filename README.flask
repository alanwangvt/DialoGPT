Tried to integrate it in the ubuntu Apache server, But ssl connection was not successful

current operation mode (standalone python flask instance):
1. Open a terminal on Ubuntu;
2. browse into ~/research/chatbot/DialoGPT
3. source activate dialogpt
4. Make sure the mysql server is running (/opt/lampp) by runing:
   sudo /opt/lampp/lampp startmysql
4. python app.py 
5. keep the terminal open for continued service.
