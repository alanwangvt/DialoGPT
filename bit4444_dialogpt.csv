"'Border' became red for me as well but there was no red underline. I changed the table border to different values (ex: changing it to 2 instead of 1) to see if it would make a difference and it did.

This will cause the red line to go away and your code should run just fine. Also reading the thread perhaps using <table borders=""1"">will do the trick as well. I hope this helps.","Gyu, this is also what I found. I'm sure we will cover this when we learn CSS.","Following up on this, I wonder if it actually may be an issue?

"For my time calculations I divided the total time difference calculated between now and Thanksgiving (given in milliseconds) by the appropriate numbers to get the respective units needed. For example, to get the number of minutes until Thanksgiving, I divided the total time difference by (1000*60) because the 1000 converts the units into seconds (there are 1000 milliseconds in 1 second) and the 60 converts the units into minutes (there are 60 seconds in 1 minute). Then I used the same concept to find the hours and days.","For question 2, I have my days hours and mins displayed, but mins is always 0.

Make sure in Math.floor() your M is capital because minor syntax errors would cause your code not to work.,Math.floor() is an easy way to round numbers down to the nearest integer when doing the calculation for the time until thanksgiving.,,,,,,

I hope this helps.,I think both q1 and q2 are supposed to be done on the Sports team home page we've worked on in past assignments,I believe we copy and paste the code from the home page and add a timer to it. ,i think we have to creat a new page ,It says that we are supposed to add a Thanksgiving countdown timer to our recent Home page and not from the last assignment.,Do we do Q1 on the Thanksgiving countdown page we developed last assignment or on the Sports home page?

The debugger in VS Code is super useful! Another good habit is keeping the console window open in your browser when checking your html page. It will often give you the exact location of problems/typos in your code if you have an error.,I have found the debugger particularly useful this homework assignment. I used the visual studio code debugger a lot to just see the values of certain variables. It can help in understanding how the variables work and what your objects value is in certain parts of the loop. It will help you a lot and I recommend doing it even if you are getting the right output to just see and make sure you understand how it works.,,,,,,

That is what I did too and agree that is much simpler than declaring two separate images.,This is actually super helpful! I will most likely implement this for future use,It is easier to only declare one image for your hover event you create. You can just reference the other image you have stored in you hw file using the src attribute and it will display it in place of the image on the page. You do not need to declare two images on the page only one. It also make it easier to reference.,,,,,

I definitely scrapped some of the things on previous pages to replace them with Bootstrap alternatives or to avoid them interfering with new code.

"I think his goal was for us to manually look for primes using math operators instead of any premade function. In that case, I'm not sure it would be possible without using two for loops, as the first needs to loop through 1-50, and the second needs to loop to try dividing that number by all of the numbers between 2 and itself and to actually check if it is prime or not.

Since we do not edit the db.php file, I am guessing that this error is okay for the homework.  ",When would the database return an error to hit the else statements and echo that there was an error? The only error I could think of for the query is to put in an employee id that doesn't exist in the DB but even that comes back as a success and goes through my $result==1 statement to show it was successfully updated even though nothing happened in the DB. Any thoughts as to why and if that is ok?,,,,,,

I think its required,It is required to be selected but can be no manager,In class he said they were required.,We might be required to add or modify the database to include a managerID column later on idk. But yes I think it is required,I think it is always required,So is managerID always required or can it be left empty? ,I believe it's set to AI in SQL so we don't need to assign it. ,Are we supposed to make it so the managerID is required for new employees even if they don't have one yet? Or just for employees that currently have a employeeID and been assigned a managerID already?

nope,Yes that is correct,Step #3 says to display an error message or confirmation page regarding the new employee update. So I'd assume if the employee ID is incorrect you would need to use an error message.,Id follow the demo,Do we need to error checking for this too? ,That's how I did it. It works fine,It's similar to the login portion of the demo. You can probably use strcmp() the same way it was used to validate the password. ,"My sql update statement is working correctly. However, if I enter an invalid employee ID that does not exist, the form submission still proceeds to the second page saying that the employee's information was updated.

Luckily since it is in php there is a preset function empty() or !empty() that will validate if the box is empty then you can use an echo to get the error message as he said in class.,Yeah I used the empty($birthdate) and it worked just fine,"thanks, wasn't sure if I was doing this right",If you just use the empty($birthdate) that should error check it for you.

I think you need to include every column except for that one.

"Hey Grant, the date input option over the wire is technically being transmitted in the form of yyyy-mm-dd (see section 5.6 of the RFC 3339). However, the way the date picker is presented on the page of a browser is all rendered and done by the browser. For Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, the formatting of the date is based on the language that's configured in the browser. For example, German users that have their operating system or browser language set to en-us will be shown 09/03/2020 (today's date) instead of the format they're accustomed to 03/09/2020. So, to answer your question, there is no way for you to change the date format for other users viewing your page.","I believe the default date is mm/dd/yyyy and I am not sure about changing it. You could always create a text box and prompt the user to enter the ""date"" in a different format. ","For date, are there other options to allow the user to input the data differently?

When strict comes into play you're asking if the values are the same type or the same value at that point,Swat is correct here. A strict equals means the value and type of variable are the same.

Implementing these with other code such as the if statement will help increase the effectiveness of your overall project.",I don't think any of the techniques are superior to the rest. It really comes down to preference and what is more efficient in your code. getElementByID only returns a single object compared to getElementsByTagName which will return an array of matching elements and getElementsByClassName which will return all the elements with a matching class name stored in an array structure.,"I don't think one is necessarily superior than the others since they all have different uses. We've used getElementByID a bunch, and it is probably what you should be using whenever you need to make changes to a specific element. I used document.getElementsByTagName() in this homework because it returns an array of every matching element in the document. getElementsByClass is the same thing, but for class names rather than tag names. It really just depends on what you need to do. As far as versatility, I guess getElementsByTagName is the most versatile because once you get the array of elements you can iterate through them in a for loop, and then use conditional statements to decide what to do with them.","For finding HTML elements, there are a few different ways:",,,,

I think this is a fine way of doing it. as long as the clock is updating every second,Are we supposed to set the future date as the election date when getting the time difference?,"This is what I did.  Since getTimeDiff() is used to return the time difference in seconds, I did the rest of the calculations using the same method as the previous assignment.  I think using getTimeDiff() to do all the calculations would actually be less efficient since you would have to convert the units multiple times just to use it.",The getTimeDiff function is very similar to what we did in the last homework.

Appreciate the help! Completely fixed my problem with the new image animation.,Thanks Jackson! This took me a while to figure out as I could not get my image to change and finally realized it was changing the animating image.,"If you new image is animating, this may fix your problem... you have to change your document.images[0] to document.images[1] for the imageOver, imageOut, and init functions. When you have it set to [0], the page assumes you are referring to the very first image on the page, which (in my case) was the animating logo from previous assignments.",,,,,

This is the same keyboard shortcut if you are using Atom as well! It works really well. I used it to add a new project folder (shift-command-O) and what I can assume would be (shift-control-O) in order to organize all my files for this class. ,"A super helpful trick I've discovered in visual studio code is the Show All Commands shortcut.  On Mac its command-shift-P, and I assume on windows its control-shift-P (don't know for sure though).  A drop down menu will appear from the top search bar, showing all available commands within visual studio code.  It makes it fairly easy to search for a command if you want to find more shortcuts for automating little things within the application.",,,,,,

"This seems like a very cool feature to use. Having looked at this resource and how it applies using the <hr> tag it seems like it may be an even better option than using line breaks is many situations. Since you us <hr> on its own line, it make it very simple to tell what is going on just by scanning the code. With line breaks, since it is on the same line as the previous code, that may make it a little more difficult to quickly notice. This also got me thinking about if you can use line breaks in the same manner as inserting a horizontal line and it seems like that is true as shown in this resource: http://www.tizag.com/htmlT/htmlbr.php

Would this only be for Atom? In Visual Studio I cant seem to find a way to make the preview constantly update.,"Many people referenced using a preview extension to view the html file as you are going. A way I found to make this extension even more useful is to first go into split editor view (ctrl + \  in visual studio code) . Once you have two editors side by side, you can use the preview, which will pull it up in a new window. You can then move it to the empty window and then you will have it open to the side of your code, allowing you to see the changes as you edit your html file. The view seen is in the attachment to this post.",,,,,,

"I had this problem the last time when I did my homework. Left-click your wamp icon-->MYSQ -->service administration--> check if your start/resume service is light-colored.

Have you ever taken a database course(bit4514) before? In that course, your installed mysql application may affect your wamp serving. If you don't need it anymore, just delete it.

Thanks! this was very helpful because Visual Studio doesn't recognize all the PHP functions and external plugins unless you have some other extensions installed,One of the neat things I found out is how to hide warnings and errors. This can be useful for warnings that the program throws that don't prevent the code from running and compiling but are annoying.  The error_reporting() function in PHP can be used to set which PHP errors are reported. ,,,,,,

Example is if you want to make a p tag and bundle it in a class called 'paragraphs', it would look something like this: <p class='paragraphs'>content</p>.

"Yup definitely agree with this, while doing the HW I was wishing that javascript was a little more explicit.","Perhaps it's just me, but does anyone else prefer declaring variable types before using them? I've come from using Java, C, and vb.net for coding assignments, and all of them required you to explicitly outline the data type of a variable before you could assign values to it. Loosely-typed languages are certainly easier to work with, but I worry that at some point either the datatype will change itself or you'll need it to be a certain type and won't be able to determine the type at runtime, forcing you to do extensive testing through a web browser. ",,,,,,
"Yeah I agree, but maybe there are hidden features.",There aren't many things like it so its a bit hard to compare. But I like that xml is easy and does what it is meant to do well. But with that said it doesn't do much. It pretty much just stores data.,What do you guys like/dislike about XML vs other languages?,,,,,

Thank you for this! This is helped me with the IDE,Thank you for this Bilal! Without the coloring it is sort of hard to understand the code being written.,I was wondering why my javascript was being recognized on Q2 but not on Q1. Appreciate the tip.,"If your IDE specifically Atom is not recognizing your JavaScript code, it is not because there is package or IDE issues. The Atom IDE is just not recognizing non HTML code right away. Instead, type your JS code out and then copy, delete, and paste it back and it will recognize the code. Either way, the code will run in the browser.",,,,

add .getTime after your dates so they are actual numbers.  Then you can do you calculation and return that number.,I had this problem too because I added on .getTime to the end of both my parameters.  Try doing your start date equaling just new Date() and your end date equaling new Data but with the day and time (in 24 hour-clock) in the parenthesis.,My function getTimeDiff() keeps returning NaN. The parameters are the start and end Date() values from last homework which worked successfully. Does anyone have an idea what could be causing this issue?,,,,,

I would recommend taking a look there: https://youtu.be/VpcHG2BrHaU?t=2544,"For the homework, the error message for the co-op question appears if a select ""no"" but not if I select ""yes"". Has anyone else run into this problem?",,,,,,

I just used this link instead of downloading jquery and it worked!! ",I simply just download the jquery-3.1.1.min file from the demo folder for the lecture on canvas and referenced it in my code. ,If you don't want to download anything you need to include a link like this,"As long as we include the jquery-3.1.1.min part in our code we dont have to download anything, right?"

"Thanks so much for the clarification! I was having trouble understanding the lecture, compared to the homework. I found some semi-successful examples online, but still didn't understand the syntax. Thanks for the insight!",Thanks for going into detail on this! It really helped me understand what exactly the code means/is looking for.,"Here's a friendly tip that will hopefully help save people some time - the ""col-xs-#"" value refers to the number of columns that the entity should occupy, not how many entities per row there should be. So,  when trying to do 1 entity per row on xs, 2 per row on sm, 3 per row on md, etc., you should base the # on the number of columns each one should occupy, keeping in mind there are 12 columns total. So, for example, to have a max of 2 images per row on something small, each image should take up 6 columns; for a max of 6 per row, each image should take up 2 columns. Correspondingly, you'd have something like ""col-sm-6 col-md-2"" for the example I just gave. I hope this helps!",,,,,

"It is also very possible to use two for loops to go through the same process, thought it might not be as easy for an outside reader to understand",That method does work but i would use two for loops just so it is easier to read and better coding style.  The counter variable would just be a local variable in the loop where if you use a while loop you have to make it before.,"I think your method is definitely an easier way to interpret the problem, but I was able to use for loops both times to get the right answer.

If it is a prime number, there should only be 2 instances where the outer number mod inner number is equal to 0.

If there weren't, I reset the counter variable back to 0 and went to the next number.","Yeah, to this we can use multiple different types of loops.

"Did you make sure to set the employee ID field to auto-increment? In theory, when there's no ID included (as in, the INSERT INTO statement doesn't include employee ID), the auto-increment should just generate an ID based on existing IDs in the table. I would recommend checking there first. ","I was doing demo 1 of the lecture and when I tried to submit an employee with No radio button chosen for Current Employee?, it gave me Database query error: Field 'Emp_ID' doesn't have a default value (1364).  This stack overflow thread

 had me run SET GLOBAL sql_mode='' and now it no longer gives me the error, but now I can add employees without giving them ID numbers which seems like a mistake since the ID is the primary key.  Does anyone have a better fix than the one I used?

"Thanks for the explanation, Joseph. This was something that I was not quite understanding but now can think of many different websites that must use Ajax for at least a couple of things. It makes sense to utilize asynchronous instead of synchronous so that the web page doesn't seem to 'freeze up' to the user when there is a request to a server. ",This link will help you.,"https://www.thoughtco.com/use-asynchronous-or-synchronous-ajax-2037228

Example would be when you're typing in a search bar and it is dynamically loading what it thinks you are trying to type out.

The only real solution is to exit out of the lecture video window completely and reload it from Canvas. Watching the lecture video in a different browser (ex. using Internet Explorer instead of Chrome) helps as well. As far as I know there is no permanent solution to this error other than trying not to pause the video and reloading it completely if it stops playing. ,"I have gotten that error in the past - your best bet is to open it on a different device or in incognito mode. I'm not sure exactly what causes it, but in my experience it's been whenever I had to reload the page numerous times (typically I'd leave it paused and have to refresh to get the video to load again), and trying another browser worked best in most cases. You could also try clearing the cookies/cache of your web browser, though I personally haven't experienced it. Lastly, restarting your computer should also fix this issue, but for obvious reasons that's the last solution you should try. ",Is anyone else getting this error when trying to play the lecture video? :,,,,

Yeah that should work and could be helpful in other programs.
